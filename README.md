🏫 I’m currently working as a Data Scientist - in God we trust, for all other things bring data.
🌱 I’m currently learning everything related to AI (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Recommender Systems etc.) and Machine Learning Engineering (Cloud Computing, deployment, etc.)!
🥅 2023 Goals: Learn to be a full stack developer - I've been wanting do this for awhile! 
♔ Fun fact: My passion is playing chess!
